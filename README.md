# Pub Bot
Discord Bot made using Node.Js with a SQLite Database for Discord Role Storage.

Can be invited [here](https://bit.ly/30G7j6Z) or you can run it on your own!

Heres how to run it:

*First clone or download the respository.

*Download Node and npm, note: node version 12 works best!

*Next enter your folder via terminal, and use npm install this will install all needed modules for the bot.

*After this node bot.js and the bot is up and running!

**Known Issues: When installing modules, sqlite3 needs to be installed individually using npm install sqlite3 --save**
